##  ðŸ“²Image gallery with filter options.

- An image gallery with filter options allows users to view images organized by categories or tags, with the ability to filter them dynamically based on their preferences. This functionality is typically 
  implemented using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity.

## ðŸ§©Here's a breakdown of each component :

## ðŸ”°HTML :
- Structure: The HTML provides the basic layout, including image containers, filter buttons, and a section for the gallery.
- Elements: A set of <button> elements for filtering images by category (e.g., "Computers", "Laptops", "Mobiles", "Watches", "Accessorys"), and <img> elements for displaying images.

## ðŸ”°CSS :
- Styling: The CSS defines the layout of the gallery, including grid or flexbox layouts for arranging the images.
-  It also styles the filter buttons and adds visual effects like hover states.

## ðŸ”°JavaScript :
- Interactivity: JavaScript is used to add functionality to the filter buttons. When a user clicks on a category button, JavaScript will hide or show images that match the selected category, making the gallery interactive.
